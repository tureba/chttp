This is a "Cimple" HTTP server

Supports OPTION and TRACE only, so far.

One instance per socket - uses systemd to manage
accepts, like xinetd used to do.

The memory management is simple: only deallocate
when low on memory and on exit. (TODO: garbage collector.)

I was bored, so I started this. Let's see how far
I get until I lose interest. -Tureba
